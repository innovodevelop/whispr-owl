# Security Remediation Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the security vulnerabilities identified by Lovable's Security Scanner and the remediation steps taken to address them while maintaining end-to-end encryption guarantees.

**Status:** 8 findings identified (3 errors, 5 warnings)
- **Critical Errors:** 3 (Private key exposure, Security definer view)
- **Warnings:** 5 (OTP expiry, leaked password protection, Postgres patches, phone number access, recovery data)

## Findings Analysis

### Errors (Must Fix)

#### 1. Security Definer View
- **Risk:** Views with SECURITY DEFINER bypass RLS of querying user
- **Location:** Database views that escalate privileges
- **Impact:** Potential privilege escalation and data access bypass
- **Fix:** Convert to SECURITY INVOKER views or add explicit RLS checks

#### 2. Cryptographic Private Keys Could Be Stolen  
- **Risk:** Private keys in `signal_identity_keys` table accessible to authenticated users
- **Location:** `identity_key_private` column in database
- **Impact:** Account compromise leads to message decryption
- **Fix:** Remove private keys from database, store client-side only with non-extractable WebCrypto

#### 3. Signal Protocol Private Keys Exposed
- **Risk:** Private keys in `signal_signed_prekeys` and `signal_one_time_prekeys` tables
- **Location:** `private_key` columns 
- **Impact:** Complete message history compromise
- **Fix:** Client-side key generation and storage only

### Warnings (Should Fix)

#### 4. Auth OTP Long Expiry
- **Status:** âœ… FIXED - Reduced from 300s to 60s
- **Risk:** Extended attack window for OTP interception
- **Fix:** Shortened OTP TTL to 60 seconds

#### 5. Leaked Password Protection Disabled
- **Risk:** Users can set compromised passwords
- **Impact:** Account takeover via credential stuffing
- **Fix:** Enable HIBP password checking

#### 6. Current Postgres Version Has Security Patches
- **Risk:** Unpatched security vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Potential database compromise
- **Fix:** Upgrade Postgres version (requires manual Supabase dashboard action)

#### 7. Phone Numbers Could Be Accessed by Conversation Partners
- **Risk:** Profile RLS policies may expose private phone data
- **Impact:** Privacy violation and phone harvesting
- **Fix:** Strengthen RLS policies for private data isolation

#### 8. Recovery Phrase Hashes Could Enable Account Takeover
- **Risk:** Recovery data stored in database increases attack surface
- **Impact:** Account recovery attacks
- **Fix:** Additional encryption or client-side only recovery

## Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Security Hardening
1. Fix security definer views
2. Implement strict RLS policies
3. Remove private keys from database storage

### Phase 2: Client-Side Cryptographic Hardening  
1. Implement non-extractable WebCrypto keys
2. Client-side key generation and storage
3. IndexedDB encrypted storage with LKEK

### Phase 3: Privacy Protection
1. Isolate phone numbers with strict RLS
2. Remove private keys from server storage
3. Implement rate limiting for enumeration protection

### Phase 4: Configuration Hardening
1. Enable leaked password protection
2. Upgrade Postgres (manual dashboard action)
3. Implement additional security headers

## Implementation Plan

All fixes will maintain the existing end-to-end encryption model:
- Messages remain encrypted with Signal Protocol
- Private keys never transmitted to server
- Only encrypted message content stored server-side
- Client-side key derivation and management

## Testing Strategy

1. **RLS Testing:** Verify cross-user data isolation
2. **Key Security Testing:** Confirm no private keys in network/storage
3. **Privacy Testing:** Validate phone number access restrictions
4. **E2EE Regression Testing:** Ensure encryption remains intact

## Post-Remediation Validation

After implementation, we will:
1. Re-run Lovable Security Scanner
2. Verify 0 errors and resolved warnings
3. Confirm E2EE functionality intact
4. Document any remaining manual steps
